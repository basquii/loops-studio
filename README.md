## Overview
The loopStudio landing page is a challenging project from front-end-mentors to duplicate their website as close as possible. I worked on with html, css and vanilla javascript, vanilla javascript for the navigation bar mobile view toggle functionality.

### The challenge ðŸš€

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

      -  Day 1: Create desktop design (HTML, CSS)
      -  Day 2: Create mobile design (HTML, CSS)
      -  Day 3: Implement vanilla JS

I started with the mobile design first, media queries, and navbar to make sure everything is responsive before I start working on anything else. 

Secondally, I did the Desktop version. I use pure CSS (SASS) to give me more freedom to fix anything as I please.  
    
I also use pug to write quicker HTML and CSS. 

The navigation bar click Event I use javascript, I learned a lot about Flex property, justifying content, aligning items etc. I had a lot of fun making this website and hope to create and design more of those simillar websites in the future.
